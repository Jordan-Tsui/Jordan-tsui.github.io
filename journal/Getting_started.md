This is intended as a way to keep track of myself and my progress in learning coding. I have a ton of things to learn so I'll keep thing short. Since this is mainly for me to see, things like grammer and punctuation will be all over the place and will be a complete pain to read. 

Things that I've done so far:
- Second year in Macewan completed.
- Proficient in Python.
- learned a few algorithms and data structures.
    - Singly/Doubly linked lists.
    - Stacks and Queues.
    - Trees. mostly binary trees.
    - searching algorithms.
    - Sorting algorithms.
        - Bubble sort 
        - selection sort
        - Insertion sort
        - Merge sort
        - Quick sort
        - Heap sort
- Big N notation.

Things that I'm working on at this point:
- My own website. mostly to show off things I can do.
- Shogi engine, I'm using this to understand how something like alphazero was created.
