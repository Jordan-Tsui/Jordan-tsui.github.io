# Hello, World #

## May 8th, 2025 ##

This is intended as a way to keep track of myself and my progress in learning coding. I have a ton of things to learn so I'll keep thing short. Since this is mainly for me to see, things like grammer and punctuation will be all over the place and will be a complete pain to read. 

Things that I've done so far:
- Second year in Macewan completed.
- Proficient in Python.
- learned a few algorithms and data structures.
    - Singly/Doubly linked lists.
    - Stacks and Queues.
    - Trees. mostly binary trees.
    - searching algorithms.
    - Sorting algorithms.
        - Bubble sort 
        - selection sort
        - Insertion sort
        - Merge sort
        - Quick sort
        - Heap sort
- Big N notation.

Things that I'm working on at this point:
- My own website. mostly to show off things I can do.
- html, css, js, mostly for the website part.
- Shogi engine, I'm using this to understand how something like alphazero was created. the goal is ML.
- markdown to write notes for general purposes.
- Pandas and matplotlib libraries for data science.

## What I'm Doing with Shogi ##

What I'm working on right now is the shogi board. I want to be able to store board states and print out board states. This requires me to be able to read and write SFEN strings. Store that in a data structure and modify it to my needs. 

Things to do:
- Create a board (data structure to store information)
- Read and Write SFEN 
- making legal moves, making legal losing moves, detecting if a move is impossible or not.
- rules / winning and losing board states.
- read and write KIFU and CSA 
- ultimate goal is the AI to play shogi. more than likely I'll stumble and fall to figure anything out here.
